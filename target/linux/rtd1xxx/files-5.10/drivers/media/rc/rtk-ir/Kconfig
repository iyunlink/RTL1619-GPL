	   Say Y if you want to use the IR remote control available
	   on REALTEK family SoCs.

	   To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	   module will be called rtk-ir.

config IR_RTK_HW

	depends on IR_RTK
	help
	   Say Y here to enable the hardware decode driver which decodes the IR
	   signals in hardware. This is more reliable, consumes less processing
	   power since only a single interrupt is received for each scancode,
	   and allows an IR scancode to be used as a wake event.

config IR_RTK_RAW
	bool "Raw decoder"
	depends on IR_RTK
	help
	   Say Y here to enable the raw mode driver which passes raw IR signal
	   changes to the IR raw decoders for software decoding. This is much
	   less reliable (due to lack of timestamps) and consumes more
	   processing power than using hardware decode, but can be useful for
	   testing, debug, and to make more protocols available.
