Realtek Synchronous Serial Interface based on DesignWare SPI core.

Required properties:
- compatible : "realtek,rtk-dw-apb-ssi"
- reg : The register base for the controller.
    The 1st one is for DW SPI core, and the 2nd one is for wrapper.
- interrupts : One interrupt, used by the controller.
- #address-cells : <1>, as required by generic SPI binding.
- #size-cells : <0>, also as required by generic SPI binding.
- pinctrl-names : Names of pinmux set of corresponding output mode.
- pinctrl-0 : The default pinmux set.
- num-chipselect : The number of chipselects. It should be 1.
- bus-num : The bus number of this SPI controller.
- clock-frequency : The max. frequency of this SPI controller.
- clocks : phandles for the clocks
- resets : phandles for the resets

Child nodes as per the generic SPI binding.

Example:

	spi_0: spi@1BD00 {
		compatible = "realtek,rtk-dw-apb-ssi";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		interrupt-parent = <&misc_irq_mux>;
		interrupts = <27>; /* SPI_INT */
		reg = <0x1BD00 0x100>, /* DW SPI */
		      <0x1B300 0x18>; /* SPI wrapper */
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&gspi_pins_0>;
		num-chipselect = <1>;
		bus-num = <0>;
		clocks = <&cc CC_CKE_GSPI>;
		clock-frequency = <256000000>;
		resets = <&cc CC_RSTN_GSPI>;
	};
