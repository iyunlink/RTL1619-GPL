Realtek DDRC PMU dt-bindings
============================

Required properties:
- compatible:
        "realtek,rtk-16xxb-ddrc-pmu" for rtd16xxb family
- reg: address range of DDRC PMU

Optional properties:
- overflow: indicating the PMU has overflow interrupt

Performance Counters Subnode
----------------------------
Each subnode of DDRC PMU represents a set of PMC groups which has its own
counter groups and controlling mechanism, but will be enabled and disabled
together with DDRC PMU.

Required properties:
- compatible:
	"ddrc"
	"ddrc-total"
	"ddrc-log"

Optional properties:
- nr_defects: the number of counters which may work incorrectly
- defects: array of the index of problematic counters

Example:

	ddrc-pmu: rtk-ddrc-pmu@94000 {
		compatible = "realtek,rtk-16xxb-ddrc-pmu";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		reg = <0x0 0x94000 0x0 0x0800>;
		overflow = <1>;

		ddrc: ddrc {
			nr_defects = <2>;
			defects = <1 3>;
		};
	};
