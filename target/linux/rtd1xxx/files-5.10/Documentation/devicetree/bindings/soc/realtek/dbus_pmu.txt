Realtek Dbus (DC-SYS) PMU dt-bindings
=====================================

Required properties:
- compatible:
        "realtek,rtk-16xxb-dbus-pmu" for rtd16xxb family
- reg: address range of Dbus PMU

Optional properties:
- overflow: indicating the PMU has overflow interrupt

Performance Counters Subnode
----------------------------
Each subnode of Dbus PMU represents a set of PMC groups which has its own
counter groups and controlling mechanism, but will be enabled and disabled
together with Dbus PMU.

Required properties:
- compatible:
	"dbus-sysh"
	"dbus-sys"
	"dbus-ch"

Optional properties:
- nr_defects: the number of counters which may work incorrectly
- defects: array of the index of problematic counters

Example:

	dbus-pmu: rtk-dbus-pmu@8000 {
		compatible = "realtek,rtk-16xxb-dbus-pmu";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		reg = <0x0 0x8000 0x0 0x0d00>;
		overflow = <1>;

		dbus-sysh: dbus-sysh {
			nr_defects = <2>;
			defects = <1 3>;
		};

		dbus-sys: dbus-sys {
			nr_defects = <1>;
			defects = <0>;
		};
	};
