Realtek PWM controller

This PWM controller provides 4 PWM outputs as sub-nodes and each one can be
enabled individually.
Required properties:
- compatible: should be one of below strings
  "realtek,rtk-pwm" for PWM V1 mode (rtd129x, rtd139x, rtd16xx, rtd13xx, rtd16xxb)
  "realtek,rtk-pwm-v2" for PWM V2 mode (rtd1312c)
- #pwm-cells: should be 2. See pwm.yaml in this directory for a description
  of the cells format
- reg: physical base address and length for this controller

Required properties of each sub-node:
- enable: turn on/off this PWM output
- clkout_div: PWM output clock divisor.
- clksrc_div: PWM clock source divisor.
- duty_rate: crest-to-trough ratio of this PWM output
